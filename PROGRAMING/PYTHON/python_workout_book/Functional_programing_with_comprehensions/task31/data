In this exercise, I want you to write a function that takes a filename as an argument.
It returns a string with the file’s contents, but with each word translated into Pig
Latin, as per our plword function in chapter 2 on strings. The returned translation
can ignore newlines and isn’t required to handle capitalization and punctuation in
any specific way
