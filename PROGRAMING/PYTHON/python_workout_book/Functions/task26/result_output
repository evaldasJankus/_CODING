Lore1 Ipsu1 is si1ply du11y text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lore1
Ipsu1 has been the industry's standard du11y text ever since the 1500s, when an
unknown printer took a galley of type and scra1bled it to 1ake a type speci1en
book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
typesetting, re1aining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lore1 Ipsu1 passages, and 1ore
recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
of Lore1 Ipsu1.
